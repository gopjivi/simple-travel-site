            Coimbatore is the third largest city of the state, 
            one of the most industrialized cities in Tamil Nadu, 
            known as the textile capital of South India or the Manchester 
            of the South India, the city is situated on the banks of the 
            river Noyyal, Coimbatore existed even prior to the 2nd or 3rd
            century AD by Karikalan, the first of the early Cholas. Among 
            its other great rulers were Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Pandyas,
            Hoysalas and the Vijayanagara kings. When Kongunadu fell to
            the British along with the rest of the state, its name was
            changed to Coimbatore and it is by this name that it is 
             known today,  in  local Tamil language it is also called as

            In the rain shadow region of the Western ghats, Coimbatore enjoys a very pleasant climate all the year round, aided by the fresh breeze that flows through the 25 kms long Palakkad gap. The rich black soil of the region has contributed to Coimbatoreâ€™s flourishing agriculture industry and, it is in fact the successful growth of cotton that served as a foundation for the establishment of its famous textile industry. The first textile mill came as far back as 1888 after that many textile mills were started and provided many employment opportunities to within as well as neighboring Districts. The result has been a strong economy and a reputation as one of the greatest industrial cities in South India.
